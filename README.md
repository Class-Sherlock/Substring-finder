# Substring-finder

Write a short function to determine if a string is a substring of a longer one. (Note: Don't use a system or library built-in function like variable.substr() or variable.contains(). Instead, write the code that would implement the .substr() or .contains() method.) Example:

	Sample input: "This is a string", "is a"
	Sample output: "Yes"
